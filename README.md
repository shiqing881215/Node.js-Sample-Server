Node.js-Sample-Server
=====================

A simple sample of node.js server

I did this project followed Manuel Kiessling's book - The Node Beginner Book

This is the link
http://www.nodebeginner.org

His original code github is here
https://github.com/ManuelKiessling/NodeBeginnerBook/tree/master/code/application
And mine is pretty the same as his as I follow the whole flow in his book.
I will use this as a good reference if I want to set up some real simple server for any purposes.
